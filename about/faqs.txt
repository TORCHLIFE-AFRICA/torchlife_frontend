How are cases verified?

Every campaign on TorchLife goes through a verification process before it goes live.

We work with:
	•	Medical documents from recognized hospitals
	•	Hospital contacts or referral letters
	•	Direct communication with caregivers or medical professionals

Our goal is to ensure that every case is real, urgent, and medically necessary before it reaches the public. We don’t list unverified or unclear cases.

Can I track where my money goes?

Yes. Transparency is a core part of TorchLife.

Each campaign comes with:
	•	A live progress tracker
	•	Updates on funds raised
	•	Status updates on treatment or hospital engagement

You’ll always be able to see how close a case is to its goal and when funds are being prepared for medical use.

What happens if a campaign doesn’t reach its goal?

If a campaign does not meet its target:
	•	Funds already donated are safely held in the donor’s TouchLife account.
	•	Donors can choose to apply these funds to another campaign or request a refund.
	•	In some cases, partial funds can still be used immediately for urgent treatment if approved by the hospital.

This ensures that no donation is ever lost and that every Naira is accounted for.
